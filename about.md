My name is Zhivko and I am currently studying at Makers Academy.

You may ask: What is Makers Academy?

‘Makers Academy is a fully immersive, full-time computer programming course in London, designed to turn people with no knowledge of web development into job-ready junior developers in just 12 weeks. We’re Europe’s #1 Developer Bootcamp, running new classes of 25 students every 6 weeks, and we’re based in the heart of London’s Tech City.’ 

Have a look at http://www.makersacademy.com/

Prior to joining Makers Academy, I worked in Human Resources. An interesting fact about me is that I play bridge. Bridge is known in the UK as ‘Granny’s game’ which was quite a surprise for me as I had participated in several European & World Championship (Under the age of 25).
