I spent the morning playing bulls and cows against the rest of the team. At 10:30 we went downstairs to present our Makerthon projects. I was really impressed by everyone's final results. The projects were:

* Modified Twitter clone
* To Do App for teams - everyone should mark a task done before the task is deleted
* Music app where you can add your track to the playlist
* Ruby gem for messaging between logged in users
* Whistling app which closes your Chrome pages after someone has whistled

AMAZING! I have a feeling I am forgetting someone's project, apologies!

We pitched ideas on Wednesday for our final projects and today is the deadline for the first round. I am looking forward to see what will be shortlisted for tomorrow when everyone will submit their 1st, 2nd and 3rd choices.

I am also seeing James Bond tonight so figures crossed that it will be good!
