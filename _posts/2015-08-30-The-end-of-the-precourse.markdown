The Precourse is almost over. The course usually starts on a Monday but as tomorrow is a Bank holiday , we will start on Tuesday.To be fair, I can't wait for the course to start and this Bank holiday Monday is really a pain. But hey any other Bank holidays are welcomed apart from this one.

As you may recall one of the challenges last week was to join codewars and reach 40-50 points. For anyone, who has reached above 125 points before the first dat at MA, will receive a reward - a sticker.	As you can imagine this was one of my goals this week and I have earnedthe sticker as I have reached 143 points :-)  Huray :)

As usual, I have provided a summary below at the end of the week.

####Most Important Things I Learned:
-------------------------------

* The Rspec tutorials were really helpful to understand the purpose of Test Driven Developement. I really enjoyed them. 
* I have finished the Food Finder project on lynda.com and I finally understood every syntax and logic behind the code.

####Things I Struggled With The Most:
-------------------------------

* Some of the Rspec syntax is confusing, not sure when to use context or describe. I am sure I will understand this next week.
* Katas - always got to the point when 95% of the tests would pass and that odd 5% would fail. Not having a pair partner to discuss it with really turned out to be problematic. I appriciate now the power of pair programming.


####Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:
-------------------------------

* I plan to do some exercises - even if it's for a 30 minutes a day.
* I have been focused too much on doing exercises. I will try to balance it and do more reading.
