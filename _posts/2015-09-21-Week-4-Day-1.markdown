Monday, Monday... Fun facts for Mondays:

* Coach rotation - every week we have a different coach.
* Our code is reviewed by the Seniors.
* New challenge for the week.

My code review today went well. Taking away responsibilities from my classes last night at 11pm paid off. However, my Controller is really really FAT and I need to put him on a diet. I will wait for my coach to recommend the diet and the right exercises.

This week we are working with databases. Our project is to create a bookmark manager and we will be focusing on:

* Relational databases
* Security considerations
* More feature testing with Capybara

Hmmm, looks easy! (Not really)
