I have stayed at home today as I waited for an engineer to come and fix our boiler as we neither had hot water nor heating. Bad news: it was unsuccessful...still no hot water and heating...

Today I have focused on the Instagram challenge. I have refactored my old code and started doing it from scratch. I think I have made some good progress and the front page is now looking like this:

I will defo spend some more time refactoring my code and making it look better.

Good night.
