Nothing much to report today. I have started reading Jon Duckett's JavaScript & JQuery book. As I have mentioned earlier, JavaScript is different from Ruby and I have started to learn JavaScript's syntax. I am also planning to finish Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS book as I have only 150 pages left.

Next week is Lab week so I can do whatever I want to. My plan is to finish the HTML and CSS's book and play around with bootstrap and make my blog beautiful. After that I will focus on JavaScript and hopefully I will be able to read the whole book by the end of the week.

Good night.
