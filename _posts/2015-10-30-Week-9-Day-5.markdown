I enjoyed watching James Bond last night - if you are a fan I recommend to go and see it.

The final project options are out. They are:

* Social music discovery app
* Team standup alarm clock app
* Cooking app
* Online checkpoint game
* Social bluetooth music app
* Tippr app
* Uber share app
* Stock sentiment app

I have selected as my first choice Uber, second one Tippr and final one the Alarm clock. I am looking forward to Monday when they final project teams will be announced.
