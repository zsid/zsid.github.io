Okay... there is a light at the end of the tunnel...I think I have managed to figure out how to create posts but ... let's see how it goes.

It is Monday evening now and we were asked to reflect on what we learnt last week and set the objectives for this one. So let's begin:


####Most Important Things I Learned:
-------------------------------

* The command line tutorials were really great. It helped me understand the basics. The challenge and exercises were well selected.
* I managed to cover the material quicker which allowed me to go through Github's tutorial and exercises. Doing some reading before joining MA helped too.

####Things I Struggled With The Most:
-------------------------------

* I took me quite a while to understand 'grep', 'ps' and 'pipes'. More exercises on pipes would have been helpful and best practices on using 'ps' & 'gprep'.
* I think 'vi' should be covered thoroughly and have dedicated exercise on it since it is commonly used. I maybe wrong but if you write 'git commit filename' - if you haven't specified a message you will go into a 'vi' editor. So it will be good to know what you are doing before starting on Github.


####Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:
-------------------------------

* I hope to start the Ruby early in the week as it will be one of our main languages. I have done some Ruby before so hopefully it should be a little bit easier.
* Understand how to blog using github.io
