Our morning standup finished quickly and we were back at our desks. I spent the morning reading about HTML and CSS. We had a retrospective as usual in our standup at 14:30 and as it would be Lab week next week (everyone can focus on whatever they want) we were discussing what everyone would be doing. You can see in the picture below:
