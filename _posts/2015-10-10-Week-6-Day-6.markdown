As you will probably know from my post yesterday, I had a birthday and last night was a looooong one. Today I am going to recover and go to Young Chelsea's bridge club and meet a friend of mine who is visiting London only for the weekend. Not much work on the agenda for today.

I also want to say __thank you__ to everyone in my cohort and MA! Yesterday was awesome! And thank you Sarah for the lovely cake!
