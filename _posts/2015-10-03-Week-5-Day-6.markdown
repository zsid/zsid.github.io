It was a great night yesterday. I was really impressed by the Seniors' projects! There were all amazing! When I think about it that will be me in 6 weeks time. LOL!

I have done some light reading on CSS today and relaxed. I will look at the bowling challenge tomorrow and try to finish Jon Duckett's HTML and CSS book.

Oh! I did Duck Punching last night! BOOM!
