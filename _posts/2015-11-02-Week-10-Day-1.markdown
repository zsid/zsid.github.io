Mondays - as always I have spent the morning reviewing the Juniors' weekend challenges, giving them tips on how to improve their code.

This Monday is also really special - for the next 2 weeks I will be working on my final project, graduating from Makers on 13 November. OMG, that time already! I cannot believe how quickly the time has passed. If you are in London, do come to Makers to say hi and see what everyone has achieved in two weeks.

My final project is to create an Uber Share app where you can find people around you and if you are going in the same direction, share a cab and split the fare. Exciting!

We have spent the afternoon discussing what technologies to use and how to approach the project. I will be pairing on creating the Rails back-end and once this is done, helping on the front-end. You can see the notes below. Can you guess who I am?
