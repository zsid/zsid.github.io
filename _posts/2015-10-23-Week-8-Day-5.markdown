I have resumed working with Angular today, doing more tutorials. I have been feeling a little bit lost this week as I wasn't sure what I should be focusing on. I will defo pass my feedback to the coaches so that the cohort after us will have overall a better experience than me.

We are also having a karaoki night this evening and it will be fun! I will post a picture tomorrow.
