I have managed to finish the logic for the bowling scorecard. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to complete the front-end. My plan for next week is to read Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz and then revisit my bowling challenge and complete the front end as soon as possible. I will also get it on heroku once it is completed.

Good night.
