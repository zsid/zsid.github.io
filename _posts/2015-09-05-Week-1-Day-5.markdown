Today has passed really quickly. I have finished my weekend challenge and I am really pleased with myself. Still, there are areas in my Rspec tests which I really need to improve: for example, creating doubles, mocking and avoid repeating myself. I will look tomorrow what's the difference between the London and Chicago styles of testing and maybe write a short post on this (if I have time). I also want to do some additional reading and complete the Boris Bikes challenge as I wasn't able to do it earlier in the week. I will also redo the Airport challenge from scratch if I have time. Hmm busy Sunday...

I have also completed my learning plan for the first week of the course. Please have a look below.

####Most Important Things I Learned:
-------------------------------

* A better understanding of TDD, Feature Tests, Unit tests, Domain Model and how to break down a User story.
* I am starting to feel a little more comfortable with writing Rspec tests.

####Things I Struggled With The Most:
-------------------------------

* I am repeating myself a lot in Rspec tests and I am unsure how to improve it.
* Not enough time to cover all of the material.


####Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:
-------------------------------

* Try to have shorter lunch breaks as the meditation and standups take a lot of my time.
* I will try to complete all of the next week's challenge.

See you later.
