![Graduation]({{http://zsid.github.io/2015/11/15/Week-11-Graduation.html }}/images/graduation.jpg)


This week has gone really quickly. I cannot believe it is all over! September cohort 2015 has officially graduated and I was impressed by every single project and presentation! 6 weeks ago when I was watching the Senior's graduation I was in awe and didn't know whether we could do it - I know now - we have done it!

My new journey in the technology world is starting now. I will keep this blog and post about my adventures in this exiting new world!

HELLOOO WORLD!
