I haven't been very well today and couldn't cover as much as I wanted. Our weekend challenge is to create a Bowling scorecard which will keep the scores for a player. I have started working on the logic and I have made some progress. What I have done so far is:

    var Game = function() {
      this.frameTurn = 1
      this.throw = 1
      this.score = {1: [], 2: [], 3: []}
    };

    Game.prototype._strike = function() {
      this.score[this.frameTurn].push(10)
      return 'X'
    };

    Game.prototype.currentThrowScore = function(pinsKnocked) {
      if (pinsKnocked === 10 && this.throw === 1) {
        return this._strike();
      } else {
        this.score[this.frameTurn].push(pinsKnocked)
        return pinsKnocked;
      }
    };

It's a start. I will go to bed now and try to recover for tomorrow.

Good night
