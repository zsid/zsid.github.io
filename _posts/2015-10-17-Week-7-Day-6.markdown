I have been really enjoying Rails so far. Our weekend challenge is to build an Instagram clone. I have generated a Picture controller which is looking like this.

    class PicturesController < ApplicationController

      def index
        @pictures = Picture.all
      end

      def show
        @picture = Picture.find(params[:id])
      end

      def new
        @picture = Picture.new
      end

      def create
        @picture = Picture.new(picture_params)

        if @picture.save
          redirect_to pictures_path
        else
          render 'new'
        end
      end

      def edit
        @picture = Picture.find(params[:id])
      end

      def update
        @picture = Picture.find(params[:id])
        @picture.update(picture_params)
        flash[:notice] = "You have successfully updated the picture"
        redirect_to picture_path(@picture)
      end

      def destroy
        @picture = Picture.find(params[:id])
        @picture.destroy
        flash[:notice] = "You have successfully deleted the picture"
        redirect_to pictures_path
      end

      private

      def picture_params
        params.require(:picture).permit(:name, :description)
      end

    end

Fun! I will post a link to my instagram clone once it is ready.
