As promised I will talk about my team project today - We have decided to build an online game called Bulls and Cows. I have always wanted to build one so I am really happy with this!

My team has 6 people on it and we have assigned different parts of the programme to the different pairs. My pair is creating the back-end logic and we have managed to finish it today. We have 2 classes: Player, Game and a module (Rules). Our goal was to make the game in such a way that we can reuse the code to create another multiplayer game.

I hope we will be able to deploy the app tomorrow and I will post a link to it later this week.

Good night.
