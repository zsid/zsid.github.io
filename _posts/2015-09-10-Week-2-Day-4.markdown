The morning started with our usual stand up at 9:00 and our research project today is on duck typing. My pair partner and I have decided to spend max 45 minutes, researching and doing a blog post. Everything went as planned and you could read our post on my partner's [blog](http://usmanj.github.io/duck-typing/).

I think we have made good progress on the battleships today. We have made our place method smarter and it now knows to raise a few errors. We are still working on placing a ship in the different directions, only South is working so far and East is almost done :)


    def place(ship)
      fail "Ship already in this location!" if ship_already_in_location?(ship.coordinates)
      fail "Wrong coordinates" if wrong_coordinates?(ship.coordinates)
      placing_ship(ship)
    end

    def placing_ship(ship)
      if ship.direction == :East
        placing_ship_east(ship)
      elsif ship.direction == :North
        true
      elsif ship.direction == :South
        place_ship_south(ship)
      else
        true
      end
    end

As you can see the afternoon passed quickly and as it is Thursday there's a yoga class... but outside as the weather was lovely! GO YOGA! I will add a picture tomorrow. And here it is :)
