Finally, the first day at Makers Academy has arrived!

I arrived at MA a little bit early in the morning around 8:00ish as I wasn't sure how long it would take me to walk (yes, I walk :) ) there. I met the rest of the cohort at 8:30 and we had breakfast, kicking off at 9:30.

We had a few intro presentations and played two games in the morning. One of the games was to have a circle of everyone, then a person starts by introducing themselves (first name, where they from) and going clockwise the next person will introduces everybody from the beginning of the circle, then introduces themselves. This continued until the last person of the circle completes the routine. This really helped me to remember everybody's name so I don't need to worry anymore about "Oh what's this person's name".

In the second game, we split in teams of 4 and our task was to create a spaghetti tower and put a marshmallow on top. It sounds like an easy task but believe me it's a challenge to complete for 18 minutes. There is also a TED talk on this which is really entertaining, if you have 6 minutes to spare I recommend to watch it.

After that we had a lunch break from 13:00 until 14:30 and continued with a few more presentations, talking about wellbeing and general health advice. There will be yoga and meditation and as I haven't done any of that I will defo have a go. Watch this space!

The day finished with going to the pub with coaches and the rest of the students for a drink. The hard work starts tomorrow.

I also borrowed a Mac for the duration of the course. It has taken me a long time to install all the necessary bids and bobs and I still have some issues I need to solve.

So yes, that's in a nutshell and I can't wait for tomorrow to come.

Good night!
