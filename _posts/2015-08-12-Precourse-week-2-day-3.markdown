Hi Everyone,

It is day 3 already and I keep thinking it's Thursday...I need to slow down.

So what have I been up to recently? I covered command line and GitHub material last week so I was revising it on Monday and Tuesday so that I don't forget anything. I have done some Ruby tonight and some on Tuesday and I am planning to revisit GitHub tomorrow as our GitHub challenge is released on Friday.

What have I learnt so far? Well, I was getting ahead of myself. I wanted to cover everything really quickly so that I can progress but it's getting messy - more methods, more commands, more things to remember. Having read everything doesn't automatically qualifies it as "progress". I should have known better...

Let me tell you a story.

My hobby is to play bridge and when I was learning to play 10 years ago (oh yes...10 years ago) I had been reading a lot of books at that time - 1, sometimes 2 a day. Bridge was pretty much 24/7. However, having read tons of books didn't improve my overall performance. I continued to do beginner’s mistakes and even though I solved the bridge problems in the books when they came up in 'real life' something was always going wrong.

So I was discussing my misfortune with a more experienced bridge player. So what did he tell me? He told me that I hadn't played enough 'boards' or in other words – I didn’t have enough experience. Once I had played enough ‘hands’ I would be able to apply the theory from the books at the bridge table. Looking back at this, I can say he was right.

So I can apply the same advice here - I shouldn't rush to read everything but go slowly, take my time and having done enough coding one day everything will 'click'.
