The Pre-course for the September cohort started on Monday (4 August). Everyone either joined via a conference call or came along to Makers Academy. We had a presentation on what to expect from the course and how to do the Pre-course work. Everyone was really friendly and we had a good laugh during the introduction stand-ups – we had 10 seconds to introduce ourselves.
So what am I going to do in the next 4 weeks? I will be completing a challenge every weekend so I need to say ‘bye bye’ to my social life.
	•	Week 1: It’s all about command line. I have managed to submit my weekend challenged this week so phew, getting there!
	•	Week 2: Hello GITHUB! I have already covered quite a bit of the material but oh my… still a lot to learn.
	•	Week 3: Ruby – learn the basics
	•	Week 4: Ruby – advanced techniques and Codewars – Let the Game BEGIN! FIGHT!

That’s in a nutshell how the Pre-course is structured. I am still figuring out how to create posts so bear with me for a moment. I will try to post every week so watch this space!
