Week 3
======

####Most Important Things I Learned:
-------------------------------

* How the internet works.
* What MVC (Model, View, Controller) is and HTML syntax.

####Things I Struggled With The Most:
-------------------------------

* I have found Capybara syntax challenging.
* I am not feeling comfortable using CSS. I will need to do additional reading on it.
* I have understood the general idea behind REST but still need to get my head around the verbs(get, post, put, delete).
* Making my Controller 'skinny' is also very challenging.


####Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:
-------------------------------

* Read, read, read and read.
