Today has been a long time. We continued with our Battleships' assignment and in our standup in the morning everyone was struggling to upload a board on the website. So the goal for the morning was clear: create a method which returns an output in an HTML format. My pair partner and I managed to do write a method by 12 o'clock.

    def print_table
    result = "<table border = '1'>\n"
    @grid.keys.each_slice(10) do |slice|
      new_result = "<tr>\n"
      slice.each do |element|
        if grid[element].content.is_a? Ship
          vis = 'S'
        else
          vis = 'O'
        end
        new_result << "<td>#{vis}</td>\n"
      end
      new_result << "</tr>\n"
      result << new_result
    end
    "#{result} \n</table>"
    end

The code would need to be refactored but we were still very happy with the result. We then had a quick lunch break and went downstairs for charity jamboree where 4 charities pitched their ideas for the Senior's final projects. It was really an interesting even I am looking forward to the pitches for our final projects in a couple of weeks.

We continued with the Battleships in the afternoon and we can shoot at our board now. The next thing for tomorrow is to figure out how to generate ships at random so that you can shoot and receive a message: Missed or Hit a ship.

Good night.
