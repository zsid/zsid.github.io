Today has gone really quickly. Our standup in the morning went smoothly as everyone was making progress throught the assignment. We rapped up really quickly and headed back upstairs.

My pair partner and I has focused today on placing ships on the board and making sure that when you place a ship over another one, the website wouldn't crash. After some time we came up with:

    get '/start_the_game' do
      @failed = false

      if params[:coordinate].nil?
        erb :start_the_game
      else
        coord = params[:coordinate].to_sym
        ship = Ship.new(session[:size])
        begin
          $board.place(ship, coord, :horizontally)
        rescue
          @failed = true
        else
          session[:size] += 1
      end
      erb :start_the_game
    end

I have learnt something new today - how to rescue. So we start with a ```begin``` where we specify the action that we want to execute, if the execution is successful then we jump over ```rescue``` and ```else```  will be executed. However, if our ```begin``` action fails, the code under ```rescue``` will be executed and the ```else``` block will be skipped.

In the evening, we decided to go to a Ruby Meetup which was orignised by one of Makers competitors. I have uploaded a picture of all of us going there. To summarise, I didn't find it very helpful and I am glad that I have chosen Makers Academy.
